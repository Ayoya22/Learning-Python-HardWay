# What you have learned so far

In this part of our learning there is no code or what so ever we just want you to go back and jot down all the important `keywords` you have learned so far.
Also we want you to make some memorization about all the special characters we used throughout this course up till now. They will come in handy soon enough.

## What you are Learning

It’s important when you are doing a boring, mindless memorization exercise like this to know why. It helps you focus on a goal and know the purpose of all your efforts. In this exercise you are learning the names of symbols so that you can read source code more easily. It’s similar to learning the alphabet and basic words of English, except this Python alphabet has extra symbols you might not know. Just take it slow and do not hurt your brain. It’s best to take 15 minutes at a time with your list and then take a break. Giving your brain a rest will help you learn faster with less frustration.
